## Core Values
The core values of the CSNG are 

- Inclusiveness (everyoneâ€™s voice counts)
- Multi-disciplinary focus (integrate different disciplines into our research goals)
- Diversity (value and respect differences in perspectives and opinions)
- Integrity (follow strict institutional, scientific, and ethical guidelines)
- Productivity (input our highest efforts to reach our goals)
- Innovation (remain open-minded, and learn from both successes and failures)
- Excellence (target the highest quality of scientific research)
- Collaboration (what is done in isolation is often accomplished better in partnership)
- Leadership (nourish from a culture of intra and inter-motivation and inspiration)

We feel that these Core Values are vital to success in science, and it is important that every member of the CSNG strive to fulfill them at all times.

It is also important to maintain a healthy work environment. *Professionalism* must always be implemented to maintain, and refrain from unnecessary or inappropriate commentary: this will greatly contribute to a healthy CSNG environment.
